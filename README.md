# Project_4

In this project I delve into the practical application of machine learning on the field of biomedicine, specifically in it;s relation to novel drug development fir the treatment of leukemia (i.e. chronic myelogenous leukemia).

## Background
Cancer remains a major global health challenge, affecting millions of people worldwide. Despite significant advancements in cancer research and treatment, many forms of cancer still have limited treatment options and can be difficult to cure. Conventional cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiation, often come with severe side effects that can greatly impact a patient's quality of life. As a result, there is a pressing need for the development of new, more effective, and less toxic anti-cancer drugs.

One promising avenue for discovering novel anti-cancer compounds is through the exploration of plant-based sources. Plants have been used for medicinal purposes for centuries, and many modern pharmaceuticals have been derived from plant compounds. Plants produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites, which are chemical compounds that are not essential for the plant's growth and development but may play important roles in defense against herbivores, pathogens, or environmental stresses. These secondary metabolites have been found to possess various biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties.

Research has shown that many plant-derived compounds have the potential to selectively target cancer cells while minimizing harm to healthy cells, making them promising candidates for the development of new anti-cancer drugs. Furthermore, plants are a renewable and economically viable source of these compounds, making them an attractive option for drug discovery.

As scientists continue to investigate the anti-cancer potential of plant-based compounds, there is hope that new, more effective, and less toxic treatments can be developed to improve the lives of cancer patients worldwide. By harnessing the power of nature and combining it with modern scientific techniques, we may be able to unlock the full potential of plant-based medicine in the fight against cancer.
