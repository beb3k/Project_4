# Project_4

In this project I delve into the practical application of machine learning on the field of biomedicine, specifically in it;s relation to novel drug development fir the treatment of leukemia (i.e. chronic myelogenous leukemia).

## Background
Cancer, as of now, is an extremely deadly incurable disease. Even after decades of joint research from scientists all over the world, cancer can only somewhat 'contained' through medication as deadly as the disease itself. It has a high burden on the patient, the doctors, and the healtchcare system alike. The detrimental effects of chemotheurapetics (drugs to treat cancer) cannot be overstated as the world shift it's focus to new drugs that has lesser side effects compared to contemporary treatment, mainly through finding potential new compounds that has potential anti-cancer activity, whether theoretically or empirically. These compounds often found on plantsm which is an economically viable source of natural compund that has many secondary metabolites that has the potential to be a new perhaps revolutionary anti cancer drug.
